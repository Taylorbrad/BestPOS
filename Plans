Plans:


Project will have multiple .cpp files. One for calculating, displaying images, user input, as well as one for inventory and one to call to other .cpp files.

Calculate.cpp - will be used for calculating prices and taxes for multiple products.

Display.cpp - will be used for displaying the icons and graphic images or icons by using the SDL library, this will also call to other functions to display other things. 

User-input.cpp - will be used to get mouse and keyboard input from the user. 

Inventory.cpp - will be used to keep track of the inventory inside the POS system and will record that information into the internal memory of the computer. 

Main.cpp - will be used to call to the other .cpp files to run the program.
